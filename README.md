# Coasties-Ship-Detection-Capstone
This repository provides an implementation of the Computer Vision capability for Object Detection using a Mask R-CNN architecture to find ships on orthorectified images.  This is based on a publicly provided codebase from the Kaggle Airbus Ship Detection Challenge 2018.  The codebase is a fork from the demonstration code provided by HENRIQUE MENDONÃ‡A and is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/code/hmendonca/airbus-mask-rcnn-and-coco-transfer-learning.
## Learning Objectives
The following learning objectives were presented during Capstone project discussions and served as the requirements for the project.
* Example of a Computer Vision (CV) project that could be replicated in an online free environment such as Kaggle or Google Colab
* Provide the ability to discover and identify ships on images
* Reduce the number of training images required via the use of Transfer Learning
* Provide an example of data augmentation via perturbation of training images to increase accuracy
* Provide a general capability that can be fine tuned to a Coast Guard (CG) image data set
  * (Stretch Goal) Provide datetime and geo coordinate information on CG image data to enable correlation with AIS data
